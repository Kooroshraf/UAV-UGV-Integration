# UAV-UGV-Integration

This repository supports the Master's thesis of **Reza Ahmari** at **North Carolina A&T State University**, titled:

> **A Data-Driven Approach to Evaluate UAV/UGV integration in UAV deployment scenarios**

## üß† Overview

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are increasingly reliant on deep learning for autonomous operations, making them susceptible to adversarial threats. This research investigates the impact of **Trojan attacks** on autonomous landing systems and proposes a **data-driven framework for UAV-UGV integration** to improve landing coordination and robustness.

## Main Contributions:
- üö® **Trojan Vulnerability Evaluation**: Trigger-based neural attacks on landing perception models.
- ü§ù **UAV-UGV Integration**: Real-time vision-based framework for UAV-UGV integration.
- üîç **Heading Angle Prediction**: A lightweight ANN for UGV-relative orientation estimation.
  
### üéØ Thesis Contributions

To address the key research objectives, this work introduces the following contributions:

1. **Custom Dataset Development**  
   Created datasets tailored to UAV tasks including:
   - UGV detection under real-world conditions
   - Visual heading angle prediction
   - Landing behavior evaluation with and without adversarial triggers

2. **Vision-Based Heading Angle Estimation**  
   Designed a lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the UAV's relative heading to a UGV using visual inputs only
   
4. **Robust YOLOv5-Based UGV Detection**  
   Fine-tuned YOLOv5 for UGV detection under occlusions and lighting variability, enabling accurate perception input for coordination and landing.

5. **Trojan Attack Evaluation Framework**  
   Proposed a methodology to inject and evaluate Trojan attacks in CNN-based UAV landing systems using modified VGG16

6. **Cross-Platform System Integration**  
   Integrated Windows (for VICON) and Linux (for ROS) environments into a unified architecture **without virtual machines**, enabling synchronized and efficient UAV-UGV control.

7. **Custom VICON API for Real-Time Labeling**  
   Developed an API to stream VICON data, allowing:
   - Real-time UAV/UGV position tracking
   - Automated dataset generation
   - Live ground truth acquisition for training and evaluation
